# catfacts.py
Pulls a random catfact from catfacts.json

## Getting Started

These are needed to be able to run **`<cog>`**.

- [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/)
- [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)
- [Your bot] This will run on Red-DiscordBot or other bots that support cogs.

## Setup

- Install catfacts.py to your /bot/cogs folder
- Place catfacts.json to the bot's root directory. eg: /bot

## Commands
```php
Catfacts:
    catfact				Displays a random fact about your furry best friend and overlord.
```

## Notes
I'm sure there are better ways to pull the data.  I may include an option in the future to utilize the API of one or more catfacts sites API, I'm not sure.  It serves my purpose for now.
